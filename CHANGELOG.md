# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. The
format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Bumped the `opensqlany` dependency to 0.2.0. Its page-trailer model was
  corrected there: the u32 at trailer `0xFF4..0xFF8` is a log sequence
  number rather than two metadata bytes plus six reserved-zero bytes, so
  `verify_trailer` no longer rejects valid pages on any file whose LSN
  has passed 65 535. No OpenQBW API changes - the renamed
  `PageTrailer`/`Superblock` fields aren't used here.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Docs: Python API reference page (`python-api`) covering `openqbw.open`,
  `Reader`, and its `tables()` / `indexes()` / `line_items()` /
  `transactions()` methods, registered in the sidebar. Fixes #1. (@Nabejo)
- `PageAttribution::gap()` and `AttributionGap`, distinguishing "no
  SYSTABLE rows found" from "SYSTABLE rows found, but every
  `data_root_page` is zero" - the latter observed on a QuickBooks
  Enterprise 24.0 file, where it means there's no B-tree root to anchor
  the position-heuristic attribution on (the block/extent scan
  `collect_unique` uses to find rows is unaffected and is already the
  only route to the data on these files). The CLI's `export`, `catalog`,
  and `migrate --format=csv/iif` commands now print a diagnostic
  explaining which case applies instead of leaving it to show up as
  silently-empty attribution downstream. Partially addresses #16.
  Reported by @pete-green.
- `SPECIFICATION.md` §8: answered two of the file's long-standing open
  questions from the same report - `flags_06` is a bitfield over base
  `0x09` (not an enum of magic values; a QuickBooks Enterprise 24.0 file
  adds a third value, `0x29 = 0x09|0x20`, fitting the same pattern as
  the original `0x49 = 0x09|0x40`), and `version_a`/`version_b` are not
  an ASA schema version pair - the triple is an invariant engine-format
  constant across QuickBooks 2018 through Enterprise 2024. The bitfield
  accessor itself (`Superblock::flags_06_variant_bits`) lives upstream
  in `opensqlany` and will be available here once this repo picks up
  its next release. §5 also gained a note on SYSTABLE row anchoring: on
  the same file the row is length-prefixed and begins 34 bytes before
  the tag our reader scans for, which doesn't affect the current
  tag-anchored scan but matters for any future work needing the row's
  true boundaries. Remainder of #16.
- `SPECIFICATION.md` §8b: preserved @pete-green's dead-ends writeup
  from building an independent decoder against the same file (#17) -
  the still-open multi-page `LONG VARBIT` chaining blocker (including
  the unresolved multi-copy/version-selection problem), and four
  methodology notes on validating a byte-level reader (a sector-linear
  addressing bug that survives casual inspection, why ±1 shifted-window
  controls don't discriminate on this format, an object-ID minimum-gap
  self-check, and requiring ≥3 distinct values before trusting a
  fixed-offset anchor). No code changes; recorded so the negative
  results aren't lost. Fixes #17.

### Changed

- Upgraded `pyo3` from 0.22 to 0.29, clearing RUSTSEC-2025-0020 and
  RUSTSEC-2026-0177; the `--ignore` workarounds in the audit workflow
  are removed accordingly.
- PyPI package now declares `keywords` (`quickbooks`, `qbw`,
  `accounting`, `parser`) so the package is findable via PyPI search;
  previously only the crates.io side had them.

### Fixed

- `SysIndexIter`, `SysTableIter`, `SysColumnIter`, `TransactionHeaderIter`,
  and `bridge_owners_to_tables` validated the E-page bv oracle
  (`oracle_bv_e_page`) with a `candidate[0] == 0` check that is always
  true by construction, regardless of whether the guessed bv is correct.
  Whenever the higher-confidence C.36 anchor didn't fire, a wrong guess
  was silently accepted, corrupting catalog and header page decoding and
  cascading into wrong table attribution, orphaned parents, and an
  inflated invoice total on some files. All five call sites now go
  through `recover_bv_any`, which validates with an actual zero-density
  check instead. Fixes #15. Root cause identified and diagnosed by
  @pete-green.
- CI was red on `main`: a newer `clippy` (rust 1.97) added the
  `byte_char_slices` lint, which fired on two pre-existing test-only
  byte-array literals in `attribution_schema.rs`. Rewrote them as byte
  string literals per clippy's own suggestion. Unrelated to the pyo3
  bump above - this was already broken before it.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- Bundle the `LICENSE` file into the sdist so source-based installs
  and conda-forge packaging carry the license text.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Release workflow now builds and publishes a source distribution
  (sdist) to PyPI alongside the wheels, enabling source-based
  installs and conda-forge packaging.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- `CITATION.cff`: author identity (Nathan Riley + ORCID) and a
  scaffolded `identifiers:` block ready for the Zenodo concept DOI.

### Changed

- README badge block unified across the Sigilweaver portfolio.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

First publication-ready release.

### Added

- `openqbw` library: read-only parser for QuickBooks Desktop `.QBW`
  company files. Peels Intuit's additive-progression obfuscation off
  the underlying SA17 page store via the `opensqlany` companion crate,
  then enumerates user tables, parses `SYSTABLE` / `SYSCOLUMN` /
  `SYSINDEX` / `SYSOBJECT` system catalogs, and extracts invoice
  headers + line items.
- `openqbw` CLI: `inspect`, `tables`, `migrate` (CSV / SQLite / IIF),
  and `forensics` subcommands.
- `openqbw` Python wheel (`pip install openqbw`): pyo3 bindings
  exposing the high-level reader API, abi3-py39, classifiers for
  Office/Business :: Financial :: Accounting.
- `SPECIFICATION.md` covering the `.QBW` on-disk format and the
  reverse-engineering record in `re/NOTES.md`.
- Workspace metadata, MSRV 1.87, `unsafe_code = "forbid"` on
  pure-Rust crates (excluded on the pyo3 binding crate by necessity).
- CI matrix (Linux + macOS + Windows): `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy
  --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, and a
  per-OS `maturin build` wheel job.
- Tag-triggered release workflow: publishes `openqbw` and
  `openqbw-cli` to crates.io via trusted publishing, plus
  `maturin publish` of the Python wheel to PyPI.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `NOTICE`.
- Documentation site at <https://sigilweaver.app/openqbw/docs/>.

### Validated

- On the publicly-available Rock Castle sample, the line-item
  extractor reaches 13,375 / 13,375 invoices and a grand total of
  $399,914,792.78, matching the value QuickBooks itself reports
  for the same file.
